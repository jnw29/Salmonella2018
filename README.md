# Salmonella2018
The Salmonella genome sequence project code-share.

This contains various programs for doing things within the Salmonella project.

These programs are here in no particular order, but the online space is here mostly for sharing between computers at diferent locations and for backup.
Much of it will deal with accessing large numbers of genomes in .fasta format and parsing or using them to create certain databases or resources.

I may not visit this page often, so messages may not be returned quickly.

Most of this will work with bash and Python 3.5. Please read markup at the beginning of files for additional information.
